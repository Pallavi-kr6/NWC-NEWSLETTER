                                            For better understanding, let me quote two real-life
                                            examples.
                                            Netflix’s recommendation algorithm: Netflix
                                            uses data mining to analyze viewer preferences and
                                            behaviour to recommend personalized content.
                                            Sometimes, users are surprised by the accuracy of the
                                            recommendations, leading to increased engagement
                                            and satisfaction.
                                            Walmart’s analysis of shopping patterns: Walmart
                                            discovered through data mining that before a
                                            hurricane, customers tend to stock up on items like
                                            water, flashlights, and batteries. This insight allowed
                                            them to proactively stock up on these items and meet
                                            customer demand during emergencies.
                                            Some of the key applications of data mining are very
                                            briefly discussed here readers.

                                            to drive insights and innovation in various domains.
                                            Data mining surprises’ means unexpected
patterns, trends or even insights discovered
through the process of analyzing large
datasets. Many a times, it challenges existing
assumptions, tries revealing hidden relationships or
even uncover highly important opportunities that
may not have been visible at the initial stages.
Listed below are some of the few surprising or
interesting aspects of data mining.
Outliers that Matter (OtM)
Unexpected Associations (UA)
Behavioural Insights (BI)
OtM: A sudden spike in a particular product’s sales
could uncover an emerging trend or demand shift
that businesses might not have noticed otherwise
UA: People who purchase higher-end headphones
may also purchase expensive concert tickets, even
though these two items don’t seem linked on the
surface
BI: Sentiment analysis on tweets during a sporting
event might show that certain emotions correlate
with real-world outcomes, like a team’s performance
affecting a fan’s mood
