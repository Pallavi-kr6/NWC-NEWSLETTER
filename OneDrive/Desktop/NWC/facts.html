                <p class="text-gray-700">The world generates over 50 million metric tons of e-waste each year, and this number is steadily increasing. By 2030, it’s expected to reach 74 million metric tons. Only about 20% of global e-waste is properly recycled. The remaining 80% often ends up in landfills or is informally recycled in unsafe conditions. E-waste contains precious metals and materials. For example, 1 metric ton of discarded mobile phones is estimated to contain 100 times more gold than a ton of gold ore.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700">That’s a remarkable piece of tech history! Ray Tomlinson’s innovation fundamentally transformed the way we communicate. Before his invention, messages could only be shared on the same computer. Tomlinson’s creation of the first networked email system allowed messages to be sent between different machines, and he chose the “@” symbol to separate the username from the destination address.</p>

                <h2 class="font-bold"> The first video game</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700">“Tennis for Two” is often considered one of the 
       earliest video games. It was created by physicist 
       William Higinbotham in 1958. He developed it 
       to entertain visitors at the Brookhaven National 
       Laboratory’s annual public exhibition.
        The game simulated a tennis match played on an 
       oscilloscope, a device typically used for displaying 
       electrical signals. Players used a controller with a 
       knob and a button to simulate hitting the ball over 
       a net. It was a simple yet groundbreaking concept 
       for its time and paved the way for the evolution of 
       video games</p> </div>
